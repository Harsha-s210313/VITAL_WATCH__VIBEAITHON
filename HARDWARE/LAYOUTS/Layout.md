## üîå Hardware Implementation Details

### **1. Signal Integrity**
* **Analog Isolation:** The sensitive **AD8232 ECG** circuit (along with its complex filter network) is intentionally placed away from the noisy digital components (ESP32) and high-current power traces to minimize noise and interference.
* **Ground Plane:** A large, contiguous ground plane (shown in red/maroon) is utilized to ensure signal return paths are short and to improve EMI performance.

### **2. I¬≤C Bus**
The entire I¬≤C bus, connecting the **OLED Display, MAX30101, MPU-6050, and TMP112**, is pulled up to 3.3V with 4.7kŒ© resistors (not explicitly visible in the main image but assumed from the schematic). All four devices share the same SDA (IO21) and SCL (IO22) lines.

### **3. Removable ESP32 Module**
The ESP32 is connected via dual **1x19 through-hole headers** to allow for easy removal. This simplified design ensures all critical signals (UART, I¬≤C, Power, ADC) are available on the headers.

### **4. Power Flow**
The circuit follows a strict power flow for safety and efficiency:

## üíª Firmware & Setup

### **Requirements**
* **IDE:** Arduino IDE or VS Code with PlatformIO extension.
* **Framework:** ESP-IDF or Arduino Core for the ESP32.
* **Drivers:** CP2102 USB-to-UART bridge drivers must be installed for programming.

### **Programming**
1.  Connect the board via the **USB-C port**.
2.  The **CP2102** chip provides the necessary auto-reset functionality to put the **ESP32** into bootloader mode.
3.  Upload firmware via the serial port using the chosen development environment.
